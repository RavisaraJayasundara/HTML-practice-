<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>I am a 23-year-old undergraduate student at the University of Jaffna, pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology. My academic journey is driven by a passion for technology and innovation, and I am dedicated to exploring the vast and dynamic field of IT.</p>

<p>I completed my secondary education at Maliyadeva Balika Vidyalaya, where I developed a strong foundation in various subjects, particularly in science and mathematics, which have been pivotal in shaping my interest in information technology.</p>

<p>At the University of Jaffna, I am actively engaged in a curriculum that encompasses a wide range of IT-related disciplines, including software development, data management, and network security. My coursework has provided me with hands-on experience and a deep understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of information technology.<p>

<p>As an aspiring IT professional, I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest advancements in technology. My goal is to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to the ever-evolving tech industry, with a keen interest in areas such as software engineering, data analysis, and cybersecurity.

Beyond academics, I am passionate about participating in extracurricular activities and community service. I believe in the importance of a balanced lifestyle and strive to cultivate interests outside of my studies, such as volunteering, sports, and creative hobbies.

I am eager to embrace opportunities that will allow me to apply my IT skills in real-world settings and am enthusiastic about the prospect of collaborating with professionals in the field to solve complex problems and drive technological advancements. </p>
